The staff there is very attentive and down to earth .	positiv
I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine ! ! !	positiv
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , fro zen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's .	positiv

The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in Chinese .	negativ
The Italian food has flavor ( that can be sort of surprising on the UES ) , and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive ,they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90's , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner ...	positiv

Service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .	positiv

We 'd go back again	positiv
Priced at upper intermediate range .	negativ
What a great place .	positiv
When my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .	positiv
I found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish I had .	positiv
Very excited to hear that short-term Chef Jason Narone has moved on , he truly was a low point of their Sterling track record .	negativ

I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough .	positiv
but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .	negativ
Not enough wines by the glass either .	negativ
As much as I like the food there , I ca n't bring myself to go back .	negativ
And it was quick which is very important .	positiv
Everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends .	positiv

I love this cozy around the way Rest .	positiv
Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car ( I happen to live in Inwood ) .	negativ

Bar was a little bit crowded , but these five girls know how to have fun ! ! it was a little hard to understand the waitress and she seemed to have little patience with our questions .	negativ
This place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .	negativ
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .	positiv
