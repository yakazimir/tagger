It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food .	negativ
Brava La Pizza Fresca !	positiv
A word to the wise - the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is THE cleanest restaurant in town .	positiv
The Singapore Mai Fun had NO curry flavor whatsoever .	negativ
You will pay a lot for the decore , but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY.	negativ
I like the ambience , it 's very dark and original .	positiv
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food .	positiv
Do n't waste money on decor .	positiv
The food was amazing , and the service was prompt and help ful , but not over-bearing or rushed .	positiv
The open-air area is not good for conversation b it still is GCS.	negativ
Big and gawky on the outside .	negativ
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice .	positiv
Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu , though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick .	negativ
The food was just awful , ATROCIOUS actually .	negativ
The wine list is also really nice .	positiv
My friends and I experienced amazing cheese and a del icious , new summer menu at Artisanal last night .	positiv

Would n't recomend it for dinner !	negativ
The one vegetarian entree ( Abby 's treasure ) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables .	positiv
This place is always very crowded and popular .	positiv
Should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it .	positiv
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends ( classmates ) too .	positiv
It took them ALMOST AN HOUR to bring out the ent rees .	negativ
Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list .	positiv
I would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it , but they were not !	negativ
This is a fun restaurant to go to .	positiv
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a first date .	positiv
Decor is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the food very well .	positiv
If you 're not familiar with the cuisine , you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they do n't accept credit cards .	negativ
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other .	positiv
It 's very spicy but not offensive .	positiv
fine dining restaurant quality .	positiv
my picks are : - Scallion Pancake ( fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty ) - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style ( one of my personal favorites ) - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish ( this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .	positiv
Tuk Tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in Brooklyn .	positiv
However , looking at the table next to ours , we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza , which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT .	positiv
The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp .	positiv
It is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traffic noise .	positiv
Best Taiwanese food in NY!	positiv
Seriously , this is the best all you can eat in town - As everyone says , the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best - have 4 of these , and you 've broken even .	positiv
If you 're in town , it 's worth searching for another place .	negativ
I am happy i did the food was awsome .	positiv
Immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .	negativ
Cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .	positiv

I would highly recommend .	positiv
Lunch came with pickels and slaw , no extra charge .	positiv
Fabulous old decor the best food we had on our recent trip to NYC . Kids are welcome--the hotdogs are great !	positiv
The food was average to above-average ; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way .	negativ
Still , this place actually manages to outdo Sparks and SW etc . on the food-front while adding just enough of a civilized atmosphere where you wo n't worry about either your neighbor or the wait staff biting off one of your fingers .	positiv
This place blew me away ...by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side .	positiv
I did n't take a look at the rest menu , but the oysters were fantastic .	positiv
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal .	positiv
Would recommend this place as a good date spot if you do n't want to drop a ton of cash .	positiv
The main course had an average portion , and was decent overall .	negativ
I 've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all .	positiv
I would n't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy , too .	negativ
I highly recommend the Sophia pizza .	positiv
The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat . . but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it .	negativ
The lox is always fresh too .	positiv
A great choice at any cost and a great deal .	positiv
Go , go , hurry , before everyone finds out about it .	positiv
The lunch special is an asbolute steal .	positiv
The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group .	negativ
Went here last night and had a pleasant experience .	positiv
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful .	positiv
It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late , raucus dinner .	positiv
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two .	positiv
I had a great experience .	positiv
i'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning .	positiv
The anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .	positiv
Busy . Crowded .	negativ
My husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .	positiv
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .	positiv
The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view .	positiv
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner .	positiv
We could not catch our waiter 's eye , and he ignored us .	negativ
Inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .	negativ
Katz 's has been a NYC original for over 100 years .	positiv
Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil , gratis .	positiv
Me and my girls will definitely go back .	positiv
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get .	positiv
This place is incredibly tiny .	negativ
We liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York .	positiv
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .	positiv
Why do people rave about the ambience .	negativ
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .	positiv
So rude .	negativ
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !	positiv
It hits the spot every time	positiv
The food is outstanding and the service is quick , friendly and very professional .	positiv
This is the only Thai place I go too in NYC , it 's wonderful , and live relaxed Jazz on certain nights .	positiv
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .	negativ
A little noise but I think that was because of our party !	negativ
Quite poor service ... Our appetizers came pretty quickly , but it was another hour till the entrees showed up .	negativ
I would never wait for a table to eat , it just is not THAT great .	negativ
One of the best Thai Restaurant .Good services .Good	positiv
Quite simply it 's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tra nquility .	positiv
The waitresses are nice--also you can just get counter service sit .	positiv
The food is great and authentic .	positiv
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys ( a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b I live in a walkup ) who always seem disappointed with their tips .	negativ
The portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good .	positiv
A pleasant surprise .	positiv
Service here was great , food was fantastic .	positiv
If you want some roast duck , pork or chicken on rice with ginger , try them out !	positiv
This is one of our all-time favorite .	positiv
and never strayed .	positiv
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .	negativ
But do n't ever order bacon late at nite ( either platter or in sandwiches , for that matter do n't from any take out place ) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos , hurt my molars .	negativ
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .	negativ
We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience ! ! !	positiv
Even better , they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .	positiv
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .	positiv
still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer ...	negativ
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .	negativ
A glass of Leaping Lizard , a glass of prosecco , and the mussels had everything happy .	positiv
My husband and I enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full .	positiv
The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar .	negativ
It was divine melts in your mouth .	positiv
Too cold to enjoy .	negativ
We asked the server for two glasses with a splash of Southern Comfort and Grand Marnier . 10 minutes later our drinks arrive and were not what we asked for .	negativ
Wine list is not huge but def well selected .	positiv
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .	positiv
Most importantly , food is excellent .	positiv
On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , taste , choice , quality and quantity .	negativ
Best dish is nori-wrapped tuna .	positiv
The noodle and rices dishes taste great .	positiv
The food was exceptional .	positiv
The soup is pretty good too .	positiv
It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap ( undercooked ) beef .	negativ
Warm , comfortable surroundings , nice appointments ( witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms ) .	positiv
Alain Ducasse is the best of everything , I mean everything was excelent .I	positiv
Well worth the trip , close to City Hall and downtown subway stops .	positiv
But they do .	positiv
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .	positiv
And the food was fantastic .	positiv
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the poun d ) .	positiv
The chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites .	positiv
Will not be back .	negativ
Who has room for Cheesesticks with the best pizza in NYC ! Get the pepperoni - YUM - and a family style salad .	positiv
Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here : simple contract , deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20 .	positiv
From the entrees to the sides to the drinks , everything was creatively prepared yet still simple .	positiv
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular .	positiv
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation .	positiv
The steak is good , the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great .	positiv
Service is average .	positiv
The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats .	positiv
Tasty sushi  appetizers ...overall the food is quality ...varied saki selection , too .	positiv
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands-down .	positiv
Will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings !	positiv
GO HERE.	positiv
Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening .	positiv
But they do n't have a toaster , which is strange .	negativ
Raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant .	positiv
I have been to Rao 's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better .	positiv
Over 100 different choices to create your own .	positiv
They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .	negativ
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes .	positiv
A cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .	positiv
The most annoying thing , though , is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue .	negativ
Eating at Ottimo is like eating in Chef Salvatore Esposito 's home .	positiv
Located at the end of a magnificent block .	positiv
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money .	positiv
Yes . It is what it is let 's all scream loud and give credit to this Old fashion Italian restaurant ina suburbed area of houston street .If this place would be in midtown or somwhere fancy ...forget it ! ! would double it 's value .	positiv
Everything we had was good or ok ....but definitely nothing great .	negativ
I am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .	positiv
The tables are close together and lunch will cost you 40 bucks , but you have to remember that you are on 57th street in NYC ! ! ! What do you expect ? ! ? !	negativ

the bagels are : big , brobdingnagian , colossal , elephantine , enormous , gargantuan , giant , gigantic , huge , humungous , jumbo , king sized , leviathan , mammoth , massive , titanic , tremendous , whopping ... best bagels in nyc .	positiv
I 'm also convinced our waiter was a zombie ; he appeared to have difficulty focusing while we spoke to him .	negativ
BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $ 23.95 is most places , but it is $ 16 here .	positiv
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !	negativ
If you go for the pre-theatre menu , it 's an even greater deal .	positiv
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !	positiv
I love this place more and more everytime i go .	positiv
We all felt it was worth it .	positiv
Everyone is welcomed in as family .	positiv
I 've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I 've been sitting there while he lectured another customer .	negativ
I 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service .	positiv
highly recommended .	positiv
We would return to this place again !	positiv
Could be pricey without a prix fixe meal .	negativ
The food was so-so .	negativ
The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .	positiv
Quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried .	negativ
I enjoy the collaboration of chef 's with Owner  Chef Colin Alevras from time to time but truly love it best when Colin is in full swing .	positiv
one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala .	positiv
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months .	positiv
The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 !	positiv
A real dissapointment .	negativ
Service was very good and warm .	positiv
I came here for my friend 's birthday and keep coming back ever since .	positiv
The dim sum is ok but does n't taste that fresh , and the little dishes do n't look steamy hot as they should ( also note lack of Chinese here ) .	negativ
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC .	positiv
DO not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .	negativ
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE.	positiv
I 've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste .	positiv
This is probably one of my new favorite places .	positiv
Authentic Pakistani food .	positiv
This is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive .	positiv
The service , wine selection , ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition .	positiv
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .	negativ
Only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .	negativ
No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation .	positiv
Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !	positiv
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle .	negativ
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! ! ! ! !	positiv
And it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each ) .	positiv
It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .	positiv
In fact , while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu , and I could n't help telling them that the food was horrible .	negativ
It is LOUD , HOT and DARK.	negativ
I ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil .	positiv
We had to ask the manager and he was very helpful .Food was great and so was music !	positiv
Service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .	positiv
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .	positiv
The editorial review led me to believe this would be a fun dinner spot , but that was n't exactly true .	negativ
Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .	negativ
Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere .	negativ
It is very overpriced and not very tasty .	negativ
And the bill was outragous .	negativ
Volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .	positiv
My friends settled for rice dishes , but we came back the following day to try the dim sum , which was good ...not outstanding , but good .	positiv
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .	positiv
Even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and rel a x .	positiv
Not what I wanted to hear .	negativ
Please save yourself the frustration .	negativ
It is not worth for that bucks .	negativ
You order from a menu , so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience .	negativ
i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience .	negativ
Heartland Brewery is by far one of the best places in NYC to make new friends and catch up with old ones .	positiv
Overall a disappointing experience for that price category .	negativ
Service is fast and friendly .	positiv
Waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree .	negativ
I did n't expect to like Nosh as much as I did , but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly , the soups are like Mom 's , and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel 's a run for its money .	positiv
Not pretentious and very economical .	positiv
Service was prompt and courteous .	positiv
Two people in our party felt like something else , and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu.	positiv
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down .	positiv

They did n't give us the dinner special until we asked for it .	negativ
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant .	positiv

You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge !	positiv
word of advice , save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you 've had the tiramisu .	positiv
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .	positiv
Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .	positiv
The fries are yummy .	positiv
But WARNING : to all those that use this site be weary , be very weary of recommendations .	negativ
all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it .	positiv
Secondly , on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume .	negativ
The waitstaff were attentive , polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters .	positiv
Village is one of those places that scores on all fronts .	positiv
The place is sleek , modern and playfull and i will return again frequently .	positiv
They used shredded cheese on top !	negativ
I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there .	negativ
A cheap eat for NYC , but not for dosa .	positiv
The food always tastes fresh and served promptly .	positiv
both are very reasonably priced ( around $ 8 for dinner and $ 5 for lunch ) , and are delicious and filling .	positiv
Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work .	positiv
Service can be tediously slow and inattentive when busy . Parking stinks .	negativ
( not even to mention baluchi 's , most irrtatingly , chages you extra for rice and all and sundry condiments ! ) i do n't think so ! this happened specifically at this location , but it had happened on enough many occassions on several other baluchi 's last couple years for one to conclude that baluchi 's has lost it .	negativ
Kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family .	positiv
The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date .	positiv
Good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .	positiv
We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .	positiv
Orsay , is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC .	positiv
I heartily recommend .	positiv
Delicious food , excellent service , and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $ 5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch !	positiv
Less = More in their case .	positiv
Just do n't do it .	negativ
It 's somewhere you can eat and be happy .	positiv
A gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .	negativ
I wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill .	negativ
Delicious crab cakes too .	positiv
Our first greeting when we entered was The last call is at 10:15 .	negativ
we love th pink pony .	positiv
Faan is sooo good .	positiv
It 's convenient .	positiv
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewher e !	negativ
Open late ( well as late as I ever got there and I 'm a night person )	positiv

I liked this place the first time but doubt I will ever return .	negativ
Great neighborhood joint .	positiv
Ummm ...the beer was cold .	positiv
Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a 'special ' bagel experience .	negativ
When we sat , we got great and fast service .	positiv
The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .	positiv
The food is great , service is ok .	positiv
Never again !	negativ
This place is a great bargain .	positiv
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors .	positiv

love the food .	positiv
Try green curry with vegetables .	positiv
When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back , in a veyr good sense .	positiv
Plus , when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night , the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over !	positiv
I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it !	negativ

I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there .	positiv
Even after getting pushed out by the no-class Famous Ray 's , Sal has risen again to carry on his father 's uncle 's legacies with a smile , true love for his community , and let 's not forget the Outstanding Pizza !	positiv

This place is worth going even if only for their beer .	positiv
I 've been a fan of Pastis for years it never fails to succeed in producing wonderfully friendly , knowledgeable servers ( I miss Eva n ! ) and top-notch French bistro fare .	positiv
Because we did n't have a reservation , we could only sit in the back garden , but it was great , secluded and perfect in nice weather .	positiv
If you go here - your focus should be the Tamarind Margaritas .	positiv
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .	positiv

Not a small feat for good french food in the area .	positiv
The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro-type vibe .	positiv
We were pleasantly surprised .	positiv
To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate .	positiv
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and made with weird rosemary or orange flav o ring .	negativ
Excellent dumplings served amid clean , chic decor .	positiv
you get nothing but smiles and great food at siam square . the jo and bo team equal great times and even better food !	positiv

Spice is sleek , modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet .	positiv

You should pass on the calamari .	negativ

We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .	positiv
If you are in a big group , this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here .	positiv

I 'm partial to the Gnocchi .	positiv
A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .	positiv
I could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out .	negativ
consistantly great thin crisp crust , inventive topping combinations and the smokiness from what is believed to be one New Yorks oldest wood burning ovens ......like in Naples only wood is used for Pizza ! as for the rest of the menu , this is much more than a pizza place ...offering such creative dishes like prosciutto sushi .....brooklyn caviar and brick oven shrimp . the salads are huge and well made and the pasta 's are not the normanl red sauced slop you recieve at other pizza houses .	positiv
Little Tonino 's is just awesome , our favorite delivery place in Kennsington , honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had !	positiv
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served ( and that order was undercooked ) , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .	negativ

I love the atmorphere @ peep !	positiv
My roommate and I LOVE this place .	positiv

Good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers .	positiv
Tasty steak , pork loin , the works .	positiv
For instance , plates were just dumped on the table , I was handed the wine list upside down , etc .... Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .	negativ
$ 6 ! ! ! All you have to do is hop on the 7 train for a couple of stops .	positiv
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .	negativ
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .	negativ
Try the Pad Thai , it 's fabulous and their prices are so cheap !	positiv
But when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get .	positiv
location twice , and the Hell 's Kitchen location twic e . ) The spicy eggplant was DOUSED in oil , the chicken was dry , oily , and tasted like bad chicken from Chinatown .	negativ
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor .	negativ
Even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .	negativ

Is just the way it was in days gone by .	positiv
Worth it for a special occasion , or any time !	positiv
Love Pizza 33..	positiv

And I could do without the cigar smoke .	negativ
The food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down .	positiv

Another welcome addition to the neighborhood .	positiv
Prices are not cheap , but not expensive but the meal is worth every penny .	positiv
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh .	positiv

I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive .	negativ
Got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full .	negativ
As for the bar , this is another bad idea .	negativ
Highly Highly Highly recommended !	positiv
Great food ( spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry ) , very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom .	positiv
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .	positiv
Everything at Sala Thai is tasty and well-portioned .	positiv
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods .	negativ
Every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair .	negativ
The food was just OK , I would never go back .	negativ
We were less than impressed .	negativ
The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants .	positiv
Terrible experience .	negativ
The staff has always been attentive and kind , and I 've always been amazed at how they 've handled all the various different group sizes that come in .	positiv
Just straight up cheap , good food .	positiv
Great pizza and fantastic service .	positiv
I have been to Mary 's many times and I like it .	positiv
However , for what we spent , overall , it just was not up to par .	negativ
This should have been done in a back room - away from customers .	negativ
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh .	negativ
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation .	positiv
A few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards .	negativ
The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here .	positiv
I love the b posters of famous Indian actors in the prime of Indian cinema .	positiv

Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before , and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had ( except for my mom 's of course ) .	positiv
Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you 'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS .	positiv
Try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for .	positiv
Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though .	positiv
Guaranteed to be a tasty experience ! ) Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you have n't seen in a while .	positiv
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .	positiv
but I was not a fan of the 'fusion dosa ' where the filling went from portabella mushroom to avocado .	negativ
Great service , great food .	positiv
There are several options as far as seating goes ( out front , inside , garden in back , etc . ) The service was good and so was the food .	positiv
If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz 's Deli down on the Lower East Side .	positiv
The decor is really blah , and not at all hip or happening .	negativ
The food there are sastifying .	positiv
wont come back again for sure !	negativ
The decor is very simple but comfortable .	positiv
They 're rude at times , and not very friendly .	negativ
One would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .	negativ
Thank You Emilio .	positiv
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) .	positiv
It 's only $ 1.95 for a regular slice and $ 4.00 for a slice with a mushroom , not mushrooms .	positiv
Food quality was excellent , service was good ( could be a little more attentive . ) Portions were moderate ...enough .	positiv
I will never visit this restaurant again .	negativ
I must give it Yon out of Yon stars !	positiv
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .	positiv
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were .	negativ
Nice find .	positiv
What makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot .	positiv
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .	positiv
The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds .	negativ
The service was excellent , the food was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool .	positiv
I 've had oysters , lamb , steak , and duck- all were well-prepared and tender .	positiv
( The asparagus , truffle oil , parmesan bruschetta is a winner ! ) Wine list is extensive without being over-priced .	positiv
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .	positiv
The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy !	positiv
I had the best ravioli ever .	positiv
Friendly and informative staff , very attentive and prompt raw bar service .	positiv
If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .	negativ
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom( third generation-Fornini ) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy ) and nothingon the rest .	negativ
Its not curry in a slurry crap , and regular run of the mill food .	positiv
I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS .	positiv
I must say it 's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view .	negativ
It 's cuz it 's so good you need to taste it ! ! ! All in all we 're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks ! ! ! !	positiv
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .	negativ
It 's boring on the inside , and our sushi was pretty below average ... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor .	negativ
Go there once and oh yes ...you will go back ...you will ...	positiv
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .	negativ
The food came out wrong , the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal .	negativ
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu.	negativ
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions .	positiv
Nothing against a good sales call , but the tactics at Amma are just too obvious .	negativ
What generous portions !	positiv
Instead of being pan-Asian , I thought it was simply a creative take on Thai cuisine ... and I 'd much rather have innovation with traditional Thai spices than another unremarkable noodle dish .	positiv
The food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .	positiv
The flavors are great , and the menu is extensive .	positiv
Overall , excellent restaurant !	positiv
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly . the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .	negativ
The entire dining experience was wonderful !	positiv
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !	positiv
I wish I lived there as I would eat at this place as often as possibl e !	positiv
I 've dined at Alain Ducasse 's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience .	negativ
It was wonderful . the salads are del icious , both refreshing and very spicy .	positiv
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !	positiv
My biggest complaint was the un-tasty food although presented well .	negativ
We also had shared a house salad that was fresh .	positiv
Food was very good , but not what I would consider out of this world .	positiv
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit	negativ
There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is # 1 .	positiv
I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try .	positiv
For years , I thought Tuscan cuisine was the best , but Salvatore converted me to the hearty Neapolitan fare on my first visit .	positiv
For $ 600 ( the most we have ever paid ) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance .	negativ
There is nothing more pleasant than that .	positiv
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .	positiv
The wine list is excellent .	positiv
I thought I had died and gone to heaven .	positiv
And all of that wo n't break your bank !	positiv
I got enough reasons to keep coming back ! ! !	positiv
The pizza was great .	positiv
The noise level was unbearable , conversation impossible .	negativ
Granted we were just the girls , but this would also be a great date spot b the ambiance is chic and bustling yet you can also hear the conversation at your own table rather than a loud din or worse , someone else 's conversation .	positiv
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan .	positiv
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .	positiv
A friend and I met at Mizu last night for dinner ; after a short wait of 15 minutes , we were given a nice little table by the window .	positiv
I finally got a chance to experience the quality of good food ,no great food that everyone should try ,after getting off at Fort Hamilton exit everyday of my life always saying i am going to try that pizzeria with the adorable kid in on the sign i am astonished at the superb and taste of just about everything i have tried so far that 's # 1 Pizza,chicken cutlet parm and my favorite chicken Marsala no one can seem to get it correctly but this place seemed to perfect its kinda surreal highly ,highly ,highly recomennded ....	positiv
A classic ! Do n't miss Bloom 's on your next trip to Manhatten .	positiv
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .	positiv
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .	negativ
Dessert - ca n't be missed , so save room ! ! !	positiv
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .	positiv
For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening , I do n't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area .	positiv
I would not recommend this place to anyone .	negativ
All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the chefs .	negativ
Worth the trip from Manhattan .	positiv
This place has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W' burg , and will impress whoever you bring there .	positiv
The ceiling is amazing !	positiv
Told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved .	negativ
No plans to return anytime soon .	negativ
Oh yes , and they lie on the phone , claiming they have seating in the garden , then of course the seats are not available .	negativ
Interior was so so .	negativ
But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished .	negativ
Interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .	positiv
Good food .	positiv
Yeah , sometimes the service can be slow .	negativ
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently .	positiv
The service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .	negativ
When we stumbled on Leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT , we were certainly wrong .	negativ
Try ordering from the regular menu , then you would not regret !	positiv
One of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the US definitely the best in Manhattan Chinatown .	positiv
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was .	positiv
Edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area .	negativ
I was glad I did .	positiv
It 's a shame that a nice , convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service .	negativ
Drinks got screwed up , she acted put upon .	negativ
My husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .	positiv
my picks : Guizhou chicken , fish with hot bean source , fish fillet in spicy source ( special menu ) .	positiv
YOU MUST GO . THERE IS NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT !	positiv
The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city .	positiv
The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food .	positiv
The food is reliable and the price is moderate .	positiv
We were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit .	negativ
We have been to Montparnasse many times and return often for good reason .	positiv
The foood is deff one of the best in NY. i love Dhal Bukhara and Chicken Makanhi . the entire staff is ver nice and helps me choose wen i need help .	positiv
But this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they 're doing .	positiv
Wow over 100 beers to choose from .	positiv
The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant , so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here .	negativ
Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .	negativ
The only thing more wonderful than the food ( which is exceptio nal ) is the service .	positiv
The dim sum here is only so-so .	negativ
It 's a small cute restaurant .	positiv
However , their popularity has yet to slow down , and I still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation .	positiv
While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich , Katz 's has a charm about it .	positiv
Chance is a joke .	negativ
less wait time for me !	positiv
We spent $ 200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed .	negativ
We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .	positiv
The kitchen however , is almost always slow .	negativ
Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics , better than places that cost a lot more .	positiv
She got us the apple pie ! ! which is soo brilliant .	positiv
I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth 's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites .	positiv
Much more reasonably priced too !	positiv
You can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation .	negativ
Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews .	positiv
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .	negativ
I 've been frequenting The Tasting Room since it first arrived in the East Village and I 've never been disappointed .	positiv
It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer .	negativ
But too far east !	negativ
Buon appetito !	positiv
All the appetizers and salads were fabulous , the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious ! ! !	positiv
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass ( that 's about 2 1 drinks ) for $ 8.50 ( I recommend the Vanilla Shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music .	positiv
$ 20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten .	positiv
We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets , and Joya is the best .	positiv
I just do n't understand all the hyp e ...	negativ
If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .	negativ
Sauce was watery and the food did n't have much flavor .	negativ
We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .	positiv
I 'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good .	positiv
there are so many thing i love about Bukhara . the furniture is awsome i love the wood furniture .	positiv
It 's better than being on the roof of Sutton Place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night .	positiv
The service was excellent and the food was delicious .	positiv
I wish they would change back to what it was before .	negativ
The food 's as good as ever .	positiv
This place is cool enough to be in the East Village , but French enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in Paris .	positiv
Try the mediterranean salad , it is a true experience for your taste buds ! !	positiv
The only disappointment was the coat check girls who did n't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night ( for the coat check girls ) .	negativ
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .	positiv
The sauce was watery and tasted heavily of MSG . ( I was thirsty as hell afterwards . ) My companion 's entree did n't fare any better either .	negativ
Definately check it out ! ! !	positiv
Food is great and ine x pensive .	positiv
They even sent us a dessert on the house because they thought we would like it ( and it was amazing-panna cotta ! ! !-so very yummy ) .	positiv
The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive , nothing flashy .	positiv
Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York .	positiv
While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .	positiv
I will be returning .	positiv
We go often .	positiv
they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece .	negativ
The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes , I ca n't wait !	positiv
This place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps Queens ' biggest secret !	positiv
This restaurant used to be pretty decent .	negativ
Everyone was more then happy with his choices .	positiv
The food here does a great service to the name ( Cantonese that is .. . ) .	positiv
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .	negativ

We ordered the steak , with 'medium' for our beef .	negativ
Kudos to Po !	positiv
The sake menu should not be overlooked !	positiv

Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu .	positiv
Our teenage kids love it , too .	positiv

Bernard is a great host ; it did n't bother me a bit that he recited the entire menu to my wife .	positiv
Miyagi is my sushi restaurant of choice in the Village ; it 's never insanely crowded , the service is very sweet ( I 've never experienced any of the nastiness described in prior reviews ) , and the tabs are small .	positiv
Trust me , it will be great , and all of it will be devoured in no time .	positiv
You must try the shrimp appetizers .	positiv
I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3 am .	positiv
This is some really good , inexpensive sushi .	positiv
The well mannered , pleasant staff that Tony has in his employ .	positiv
Definitely Highly NOT recommended .	negativ
They even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little .	positiv

They have some great entrees here as well .	positiv
Also very ine x pensive .	positiv

I 've been to plenty of great sushi spots in manhattan ; Faan is always my favorite for sushi and chinese .	positiv
I pray it stays open forever .	positiv
I 've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed .	negativ
What I did n't like was how the food came right after it was ordered .	negativ

I 've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city .	positiv
Check it out .	positiv

Had a fantastic omlette here ... sandwiches are about 6 inches high and filled with layers of deli meat goodness .	positiv
Save your money and do n't waste your calories , go to Margharita 's on Washington Street instead , they have amazing food and the BEST service .	negativ
I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal .	positiv
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .	negativ

Oh , and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough- yummy !	positiv

The best thing I tasted were the lambc hops .	positiv
The employees are excellent .. some even know me by name and order ( pathetic for me ) ...i just ca n't stay away !	positiv
Definitely not a restaurant to skip !	positiv
Staff members are fluent in Japanese and English , and very knowledgeable about their food ( very rare to find at most Japanese restaurants in the US.. . ) Pricy indeed , but atmosphere and the setting pays off ( stone dish is very elegant . ) Excellent for bringing a date to impress , or business dinner .	positiv
The quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .	positiv
We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right .	positiv
Not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .	positiv

Great Indian food and the service is incredible .	positiv
The staff offers impeccable service .	positiv

This big draw is the all you can sushi here for $ 19.95 !	positiv
Anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment .	negativ
Plus they made a perfect martini .	positiv

The Yellowtail was particularly good as well .	positiv
The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service .	positiv
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere .	positiv
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine !	positiv
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc .	positiv
Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe 's to eat here .	positiv
I went to pams with my girlfriend , and i love it .	positiv
A defitely must visit .	positiv
Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .	negativ
Good atmosphere , combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays .	positiv
Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries .	negativ
If you live outside the neighborhood , do n't bother !	negativ
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry , inedible chicken with terrible sauce .	negativ
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York .	positiv
THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT .	positiv
Delivery service is great too .	positiv
I 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .	positiv
Fish is so very fresh .	positiv
Amazing !	positiv

Dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty Indian restaurant in the upper east side .	positiv
All in all a wonderful experience , ca n't wait to come back .	positiv
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens , this is among the best .	positiv
The staff is also attentive and friendly .	positiv
We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for .	positiv
All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner .	negativ
I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy .	positiv
I like Mamoun 's food as well , but side by side , Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down .	positiv
This made it obvious that the food was n't cooked fresh ; it was obviously made before hand and then reheated .	negativ
The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so do n't be a greedy pig !	negativ
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time .	positiv
While the prices are nothing special , the portions are huge .	positiv
Wonderful at holiday time .	positiv
This is n't a value joint .	negativ
I think the stuff was better than Disney .	positiv
Enjoy ! ! !	positiv

The place was quiet and delightful .	positiv
I definitely would n't go back .	negativ

The food was very good , but not very thai .	positiv
this restaurant reminds me why i love brooklyn ,the food is great the ambience is fun and the service is very friendly and get this the prices make most restaurants look like rip off joints .do	positiv

This quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip .	positiv
Their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for Purple Haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request !	positiv
Overall I would recommend it and go back again .	positiv
For sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves .	positiv
When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli , I knew there was going to be good pizza !	positiv
Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal .	positiv
Not worth the prices .	negativ
Always popular , always full , always a wait .	positiv
A very inviting restaurant , with friendly service .	positiv
From beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sor bet , we were delighted by the taste sensations .	positiv
Suan was a recommendation that I am glad we heeded .	positiv
Really cool stauff inside .	positiv
night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .	positiv
Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from , but we had been there less than an hour and they had n't even brought us a check yet !	negativ
The corned beef and pastrami are excellent , much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square .	positiv
The New York Times has reviewed this place three times already , you know it 's going to be good .	positiv
Not a typical pizza joint , but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner .	positiv
the real kicker of the menu , however , is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass .	positiv
Try the sea bass .	positiv
The wine the service was very good too .	positiv
Walk-ins are risky too .	negativ
I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad ( they are all good ) It is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat .	positiv
I 'm happy to have Nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting .	positiv

Again , the waitress was awesome .	positiv
The food options rule .	positiv
Park your trench coat at the coat check and be prepared for fine dining , expert  attentive table service and a delectable cuisine .	positiv
Major reasons why it gets a higher rating from me : 1 . it is less crowded and the service is better ( including more personal ) , 2 . the menu is longer , and includes great things like huo guo ( aka hot pot or nabe ) that are not found at the Chelsea branch .	positiv
We were a group of 8 and well seved .	positiv
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large Pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .	positiv
Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer ....	negativ
I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it .	positiv
No dress codes , no attitudes , plenty of comfort companionship , a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown .	positiv
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood .	positiv
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant .	positiv
When you 're sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceili n g ) you 'd never know there was a world outside .	positiv
Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal , relax , be able to talk and have a very good time .	positiv
Very cozy and warm inside .....I will be back !	positiv
Decent wine selection too .	positiv
I 'm not picky - but it was actually gross .	negativ

The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table .	positiv
The bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .	positiv

Murray wo n't do it .	negativ
This place is a great stop for great food .	positiv
Only had delivery so ca n't speak to ambience , but considering the lack of attention they give the food , there certainly ca n't be much to see there .	negativ
When we notified him that he did n't mention the specials , he did n't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless .	negativ

Service was also very good .	positiv
Molto bene !	positiv
Even with the prix fixe pricing , this restaurant is not worth it .	negativ

The food was actually aweful .	negativ
Ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .	positiv
The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty .	negativ
We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich .	negativ
The food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not .	positiv
Another plus is most of the entrees are approx .	positiv
My fav was the sassy lassi...	positiv

Nothing special about this place .	negativ
However , once we sat down , they only gave us their regular menu.	negativ

This time , I prefer not to go into detail .	negativ

We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the bar when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .	negativ
There is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude .	negativ
My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them , as they tend to offer large portions .	positiv

Stay away from the latter since you wo n't go for seconds ( hint hint ) .	negativ
The atmosphere is n't the greatest , but I suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .	negativ
The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints , and has a bar which deserves a mention .	positiv
There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here .	positiv

We had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant .	negativ
a friend and I went there for dinner one sunday and were pleasantly surprised ( as she had embaked on the quest to try all the reastaurants with me . ) the waiters work together to serve you quickly without making you feel rushed . the food is spicy by nature ..l .	positiv
If it 's just a quick martini at the bar ( which I recommend Jeffery 's ) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken , go to Village !	positiv
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .	positiv

and you ca n't beat the prices .	positiv
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had ( I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat ) .	positiv
The bagels are also reasonably priced for NYC .	positiv
Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar ve nues .	positiv
Beef noodle soup is good as well .	positiv
The red curry is weak and tasteless , the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy , the rice is often overcooked , and the seafood is pretty sketchy .	negativ
i will definitely go back ! ! Sports on flat screen tv above bar kept me entertained through 3 rounds .	positiv
I have eaten there 3-4 times and the food was always good .	positiv
Also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .	negativ

I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lob ster .	positiv
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal .	positiv
Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall , it 's a bit intimidating at first , but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - do n't hesitate to ask for help with what to get .	positiv
