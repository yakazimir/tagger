Ahhh ...	positiv
During our meal , the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks .	positiv
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great .	positiv
Avoid at all costs .	negativ
The service , however , was a bright flower in a garden .	positiv
I look forward to eating here again	positiv
But other than that ..not bad at all !	positiv
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice .	positiv
The wait staff is very friendly , if not overly efficient .	positiv
I felt as though I were eating in Paris .	positiv
Good crowd , good outdoor seating , with a hip japanese vibe .	positiv
I actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this , but the second visit was even worse .	negativ
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque .	positiv
Delivery is fast too .	positiv
The sushi has been from average to below average , the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating (if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen , the acousitcs are horrid , everything echoes is extremely loud ) .	negativ
We were not disappointed .	positiv
If you 'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent , Long Tan is a good place on the slope .	positiv
Killer Sushi !	positiv
menu has so many fish items and oysters.We	positiv
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !	positiv
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there .	positiv
First , the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials , which I would have chosen had I known about them .	negativ
Another great place to take out-of-towners !	positiv
The food was not fresh , the sauces were bland and very oily .	negativ
I love the tongue sandwiches , grilled hotdogs potato latkes w apple sauce .	positiv
Do n't judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .	positiv
The NYC has available to it so many different vegetables , meats , and fishes ; and Japanese cuisine has a number of unique foods and preparations all of which could have been used here with greater effect but all we get almost nothing of the sort .	negativ
The pizza here is delicious .	positiv
Threw my fiance 's surprise 30th birthday dinner here could n't be happier .	positiv
Gigino 's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable .	positiv
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .	positiv
Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great .	negativ
The service is awful .	negativ
Food was OK - fish was cooked well .	positiv
Worse of all , $ 60 was erroneously added to our $ 80 bill .	negativ
The food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great .	positiv
Unbelievable .	positiv
( food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter ) We got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .	negativ
My steak au poivre was one of the worst I 've had .	negativ
The dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it .	negativ
Chance is a small cozy restaurant , with a romantic feel to it , the decor is great .	positiv
Do n't eat here unless you 're starving for thai food and you work next door .	negativ
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap .	positiv
Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal .	negativ
The wine is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .	positiv
The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .	negativ
The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud .	negativ
Good for dates or with friends .	positiv
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .	positiv
black white shakes came out good also .	positiv
Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch !	positiv
Grilled whole fish wonderful , great sp icing .	positiv
great eats , good times .	positiv
Thanks Bloom 's for a lovely trip .	positiv
What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the food is really good .	positiv
This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list .	positiv
They also have Korean BBQ and very beer-friendly Korean appetizer(like Kim Chee ) .	positiv
Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .	negativ
The seating is cramped ; the drinks exceptionally pricey and watered down , and there is only ONE unisex bathroom ( YUCK! ! ! ) .	negativ
An oasis of refinement : Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef 's passion ( and kitchen 's precise execution ) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups .	positiv
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .	positiv
Try the lasagnette appetizer .	positiv
If it is n't for the food ( A+++ ) , it must be the service or the ambience .	positiv
Kind , attentive wait staff .	positiv
Never fails to please .	positiv
If you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here !	positiv
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna .	positiv
The menu is Prix Fixe , so be prepared to spend at least $ 60 per person , but it is Well worth itsuperb food .	positiv
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York .	positiv
Try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel .	positiv
They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine , so if you want to make a reservation you are limited .	negativ
The staff is courteous and friendly .	positiv
We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night .	positiv
No free drink .	negativ
Place was loud , not very romantic , food was 2.5 service was 3 .	negativ
The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet , we were told no...Then , to top things off , she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend 's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes .	negativ
And despite Gabriella 's claim that she uses only the finest ingredients ; the Grand Dame has been seen purchasing cases of Kraft string cheeze at Cosco .	negativ
I would definently recommend this restaurant .	positiv
The food was just OK , at least for what food was available .	negativ
Satisfying .	positiv
Zero ambiance to boot .	negativ
it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food .	positiv
It has been my first choice ever since I discovered it .	positiv
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho .	negativ
The setting is casual and romantic .	positiv
I 've waited over one hour for food .	negativ
I would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space .	positiv
You will be satisfied .	positiv
It 's simply the best meal in NYC .	positiv
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ...a bucket of food literally .	positiv
Also , the sandwiches ( n earing $ 7 ) did n't come with anything like chips or a side .	negativ
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .	positiv
And everytime I go there 's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front .	negativ
No. He stood there looking us up down then walked away .	negativ
The food 's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate , truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine .	positiv
Oh , but wait , we were out of drinks ( which were also delightfully overpriced ) .	negativ
The parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed .	positiv
But I 'd go back	positiv
All the staff is absolutely professiona l ! ! I sometimes see the waiters do n't have enough knowledge of their dishes .	positiv
i dont how this place is still running .	negativ
After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : Where are you from ...maybe you dont know how things work in America ...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .	negativ
Never once did I leave feeling unwelcome or impressed .	positiv
To me it exemplifies Soho , cute , artsy , interesting .	positiv
This restaurant is such a great place .	positiv
All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners .	positiv
Would definitely visit again .	positiv
I LOVED THE SHOWS .	positiv
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .	positiv
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .	negativ
The fried rice is really good too .	positiv
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .	negativ
Dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time .	negativ
But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like 'bar ' or 'pub' .	negativ
Food-awesome .	positiv
The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and ca n't wait to try the fondue or table grilling .	positiv
I 'll be back soon .	positiv
I take all my NYC guests to VT 's .	positiv
There is no excuse for such lousy servic e !	negativ
Try their chef 's specials-- they are to die for .	positiv
The service is descent even when this small place is packed .	positiv
Tends to turn people away .	negativ
Would n't have it any other way ... made great recommendations and gave out group the full treatment .	positiv
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem .	positiv
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .	negativ
The food was boring and expensive .	negativ
I ca n't wait to go back .	positiv
A guaranteeed delight !	positiv
if you dont even like thai-food ..still go there ..i recommend going there just for the atmosphere and kind people alone .	positiv
Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident , but for the rest of us who 've actually eaten ethnic food , this is simply dull .	negativ
Not impressed with the food .	negativ
We ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .	negativ
I have never had anything like it !	positiv
And affordable .	positiv
The svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !	negativ
And the soup bombs here , lovingly called Pork Dumplings with Soup ( ha ! ) are an experiance .	positiv
Baluchi 's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .	positiv
The food is excellent and I have found this location at 104 2nd Avenue to be the most consistent with its food and short menu.	positiv
Great deal !	positiv
The service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald 's than this joint .	negativ
The space is a bit too small for live music , so on jazz nights , it can be loud and cramped .	negativ
Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll. . .	positiv
For the location , the prices are very reasonable .	positiv
Definitely not worth the pric e !	negativ
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .	negativ
If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I 'd go out in Manhattan .	negativ
They are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch .	positiv
The other night we had the $ 30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if I could of licked the plate clean I would of .	positiv
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .	negativ
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the BTs .	positiv
The point is , the steak was phenominal , the cocktails and sides perfect and the price .......much less than what we expected to pay .	positiv
I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish .	positiv
I got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .	positiv
Everything about this restaurant was special .	positiv
The waiter was attentive .	positiv
The mussles were the fishiest things I 've ever tasted , the seabass was bland , the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese , the penne w chicken had bones in it ... It was disgusting .	negativ
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .	positiv
From the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of foods , it was impossible to criticize the food .	positiv
Staff was cool enough to exlplain all the different sakes ( they have a small but delicious selec tion ) and make amazing recommendations .	positiv
We were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course ( other restaurants offer 3 choices ) and ended up ordering a la carte .	negativ
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic .	positiv
From the incredible food , to the warm atmosphere , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat .	positiv
My boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed .	positiv
Have been several times and it never dissapoints .	positiv
Decent wine at reasonable prices .	positiv
Yes , there might be a wait if you have no reservations .	negativ
So all I 'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant I 've ever been to .	positiv
The food is great and reasonably priced .	positiv
this place is amazingly bad .	negativ
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !	positiv
The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table .	negativ
The ambience is very calm and quiet .	positiv
This is the kind of place you 'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .	positiv
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris .	positiv
There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times .	negativ
For the people who want great food plus great service , Roxy is a place to AVOID !	negativ
Order the panang duck , it 's fantastic .	positiv
It was huge , del icious , fresh , and will be the reason we return .	positiv
The Thali was small , thoroughly unremarkable , and $ 14.95 .	negativ
and hey the prices ?? ? ? nothing for the midtown and Rock Plaza .	positiv
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not Mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .	negativ
Food and service was okay .	positiv
not only does make the best pizza in NY , maybe anywhere .	positiv
Great atmoshere and worth every bit .	positiv
Of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious !	positiv
keep up the good work .	positiv
I absolutely love this place ! ! !	positiv
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter .	positiv
Our tiny table for two ( dinner plates hung over edge ) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic .	negativ
Sapphire is the only Indian restaurant I go to when I 'm in NYC .	positiv
We will be back .	positiv
Our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy .	negativ
All I can say is WOW !	positiv
While this is n't classical restaurant fare , the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs .	positiv
As many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .	negativ
We were pleasantly gre eted .	positiv
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration .	positiv
Even with John 's and Joe 's around the corner , this place will make a name for itself .	positiv
I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix .	positiv
Beautiful experience .	positiv
Any how , we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat , which was nice .	positiv
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read .	negativ
this is the best secret place in midtown' , I heard that from the bartender , after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms ) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday .	positiv
You are treated just like royality .	positiv
Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .	positiv
It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone 's living room .	negativ
I 've never felt more unwelcome than last month at Jimmy 's Bronx Cafe .	negativ
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .	negativ
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .	negativ
Plus , on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited !	positiv
All conveniently delivered right to the door .	positiv
I 've never been disappointed .	positiv
we did notice however , that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan .	negativ
The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else .	negativ
But the pizza is way to expensive .	negativ
The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager ( a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile ) truly cared about how we were doing .	positiv
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money .	positiv
This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner .	positiv
Go inside and you wo n't want to leave .	positiv
Service is great , takeout is good too .	positiv
When you want a piece of beef , head on over .	positiv
If you love seafood , you would love this place !	positiv
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .	positiv
The burger was great , also .	positiv
Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza , the house salad , and a good bottle of wine .	positiv
I will not be coming here at 3am again .	negativ
Wonton dough filled with gently steamed and seasoned pork are common but add this amazing soup to the wonton , seal it and serve it steaming hot and the dumpling becomes new again ...this place is amazing for those dumplings alone but try the wine chicken and the scallion pancakes as well .	positiv
Nice amb iance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good service .	positiv
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .	negativ
Overall , worht every penny .	positiv
I LOVE their spicy scallop roll , and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken .	positiv
This restaurant was way overhyped .	negativ
I 'm going back .	positiv
I 've always been seated propm tly .	positiv
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks .	positiv
Jimmy 's is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bron x.	positiv
If you live in new york city , you 'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount .	negativ
Everything was wonderful ; food , drinks , staff , mileau .	positiv
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range .	positiv
asked for italian dressing received ceaser w anchovies , asked for xtra napkins , forks and peper never got them .	negativ
I will go back to Suan soon !	positiv
Now it 's so crowded and loud you ca n't even talk to the person next to you .	negativ
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee ! !	positiv
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .	positiv
The food is mostly made from scratch , fresh and well prepared .	positiv
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot .	positiv
It 's all about the food ! !	positiv
The decor is nice , but more casual than fine dining .	positiv
I do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant .	negativ
This was a great surprise .	positiv
We were very pleasantly surprised .	positiv
The restaurant has a Family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine .	positiv
Their eggplant is so delicate , sweet tender !	positiv
I would go back tho .	positiv
We arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but , that 's just it -- the PAST !	negativ
But the traditional items -- yellow eel , eggplant , mock chicken , fried juicy buns , etc . ( which most tourists do n't order ) -- are prepared with traditional flavor , harboring a semi-sweet , juicy taste .	positiv
For the quality of food , a little too expensive .	negativ
The service is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better .	positiv
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent .	negativ
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .	positiv
Great romantic place for a date ( try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close ! ) .	positiv
But that is highly forgivable .	positiv
I do n't get it either .	negativ
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else .	positiv
This is n't your corner Chinese food takeout .	positiv
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED !	positiv
This was n't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup , but I thought that was what made the place so special .	positiv
The staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .	negativ
Fast service .	positiv
Service was warm and attentive , beef carpaachio was exellent ( huge portion ) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared .	positiv
I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .	positiv
I almost think you can get away with a salad pasta ....by the time you get to the entrees you are struggling to finish , given the decent portion sizes of salads , pasta plus the bread brushetta to start .	positiv
Definitely a neighborhood favorite .	positiv
They all know you .	positiv
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals .	positiv
I 'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much ... and we 're repeat customers .	positiv
All the food was hot tasty .	positiv
My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant .	positiv
You will not be disapointed at all .	positiv
Fantastic !	positiv
Everything is excellent , the menu is quite extensive , and you eat with a view on both sides of the city .	positiv
The 'kamasutra ' and 'bombay cosmopolitan' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time .	positiv
Then , get ripped on free box wine .	positiv
THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO !	positiv
I thought that she has been working there only cuz of her look to get some guys in the suit , but she is propably the friendliest female bartender in NYC . and that Asian girl .	positiv
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .	positiv
There 's something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style .	positiv
The food was authentic .	positiv
A friend of mine took me for a birthday dinner here and it was ...quite amazing .	positiv
For all of you new to Indian food , try the Paneer Roll , it is a piece of heaven .	positiv
Worth making the trip down to Kensington for ...really !	positiv
When we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check .	negativ
After all that , they complained to me about the small tip .	negativ
The best Chicken pad tai , I 've ever had .	positiv
The food was very well prepared .	positiv
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in food quality , to the much overpraised ( and underdeserving ) baluchi 's .	positiv
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .	positiv
We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses !	positiv
Try it side by side and there 's no comparison .	positiv
Other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .	positiv
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate .	positiv
I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni . ( For those of you who do n't know , Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese , which happens to be my favorite . ) He served me an Uni Hand roll , which I never had before , and let me tell you ...IT WAS HEAVEN !	positiv
If just to drop in , quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over .	negativ
Went inside and I started to get excited .	positiv
however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .	negativ
Also they were $ 15 each !	negativ
In reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .	negativ
Frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison .	positiv
We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied .	positiv
They were such a rip-off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying .	negativ
They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -RESUL T - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL.	negativ
Dinner , with wine , ended up costing around $ 130 ...not a bad deal when you consider how flavorful and large the portions are !	positiv
Bon appettite ! !	positiv
The prices are wonderfully low .	positiv
Everyone treats you like you were part of the family .	positiv
Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs , so be aware .	negativ
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .	positiv
We made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed , reminds me of my grandfather , its old school Italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire .	positiv
Great find ! ! !	positiv
Based on the reviews for dinner , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again .	negativ
you guys rock .	positiv
This was a repeat visit and we 'll definitely be back again .	positiv
With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .	negativ
Please try the Filet Mignon , its just the most tender piece ever .	positiv
I have n't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil .	positiv
The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we 've ever had ! ! The lamb was tender so full of flavor , the dessert was divine ! !	positiv
But that was n't the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had .	negativ
This is my fourth try over a two year period , and I 'm done .	negativ
OU MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT .	positiv
Be careful of portions - they 're HUGE.	positiv
By far , the best pizza in Manhattan .	positiv
IT WAS HORRIBLE.	negativ
Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot .	negativ
Rao 's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC .	positiv
I thought this place was totally overrated .	negativ
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde .	positiv
They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent .	positiv
Great food and the prices are very reasonable .	positiv
i recommend the thai popcorn : )	positiv
I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .	positiv
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .	positiv
They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared .	positiv
Amma is nothing special .	negativ
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded .	positiv
if you 're daring , try the balsamic vinegar over icecream , it 's wonderful !	positiv
great wine list ( italian ) , good food , service was INITIALLY fine .	positiv
Given the incredible architecture surrounding it , this place has no character .	negativ
I loved it and will be back soon .	positiv
So , for good food i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out .	positiv
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening .	positiv
Yet paired with such rude service , would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there .	negativ
Obviously run by folks who know a pie .	positiv
not worth it ; visit the other ones for real monster sushi goodness .	negativ
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .	negativ
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .	positiv
We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant !	negativ
No apologies during restaurant week .	negativ
I 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .	negativ
I 've been eating at Taj Mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the Indian eateries on this block of Indian restaurants .	positiv
Like others have said , do n't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes , a busy restaurant may require you to wait .	negativ
The restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible , reaching for sunglasses .	negativ
Yeah , it 's that good .	positiv
The best pad thai i've ever had .	positiv
While most people can attest to spending over $ 50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing , the drinks here are plentiful and unique .	positiv
Unique apppetizers .	positiv
The sushi was awful !	negativ
Outstanding Bagels , but you get what you pay for .	positiv
This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff .	positiv
We were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available .	negativ
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce !	positiv
I could n't reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher .	positiv
